# Bot-x

## Overview

This project implements a chatbot using Flask and PyTorch. Users can train the bot with custom responses stored in a `data.json` file using the `training.py` script. After training, the chatbot can be run using the `app.py` script, and it will provide responses based on the trained data saved in `data.json`.
